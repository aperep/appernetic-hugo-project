    problem: There is a rectangle on the checkered plane (all cells are squares 1 Ã— 1) drawn along grid lines. The rectangle was cut into *N* rectangles along the grid lines by several horizontal and vertical cuts from one side to the other. Prove that it is possible to paint some of these *N* rectangles (maybe only one or all) so that the colored area would be a rectangle of area divisible by *N*.
